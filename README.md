# Clever Title

A simple game written in HaxeFlixel for the Hawaii Mountain View Public/School Libraries 2019 Summer Reading Program.
The art in the game was created by children as part of a presentation on the art and science of video games, and 
included a presentation covering the general process of creating a video game. 

The object of this game is to dodge the asteroids as they approach the player's ship. After 30 seconds pass the
finish line will spawn, touching the finish line ends the game. Colliding with an obstacle causes the player to
lose. There are three difficulty levels, each increases the speed and frequency of the obstacles spawning. 

To play this game HaxeFlixel must be installed.
